# Dynamic Routing Wildcards
Dynamic Routing Wildcards for Kentico is an extension of <a href="github.com/KenticoDevTrev/DynamicRouting">KenticoDevTrev's Dynamic Routing Package</a>. In KenticoDevTrev's package you are able to link Views, Controllers and Pages to customisable routes in Kentico MVC. With this package you can now introduce parameters to your Urls. For example if I have a url */blog* but I want to filter my blog listing page to only show certain categories, I can add the url */blog/{category}*. This will route to the original page and add parameters to the route data to parse into your controller actions.
